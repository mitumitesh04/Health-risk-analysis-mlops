# Health Risk Analysis MLOps Pipeline
## 🎯 Overview

A **production-ready end-to-end MLOps pipeline** for health risk prediction that demonstrates modern machine learning engineering practices. The system predicts individual health risk levels using vital health metrics (heart rate, daily steps, sleep patterns, age) while implementing comprehensive DevOps automation, experiment tracking, and real-time monitoring.

### 🎖️ Key Achievement
Built a complete **MLOps ecosystem** that automates the entire ML lifecycle from data ingestion to model serving, featuring containerized microservices, automated CI/CD, and comprehensive monitoring - **ready for enterprise deployment**.
